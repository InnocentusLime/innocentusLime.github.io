# Hello

My name is Innokentii. I am a beginner software engineer with a passion towards game development and development of software that requires as little as possible! Sometimes I also do WASM stuff mainly to make games running in a browser

I usually code in Rust, but I sometimes do projects in languages like C, Java and Go.

# A few words

I am a graduate of Neapolis University Pafos with bachelors in Applied Computer Science with lots of extracurricular courses from JetBrains academy. During my studies I also got to be an intern in PLAN labs @ JetBrains research, where I could co-author an amazing article about the XMM memory model[^1].

Even before that I trying out Rust in various ways during the 10th grade of school, which helped me get where I am today.
