# Hello

My name is Innokentii. I am a beginner software engineer! My main language currently is Rust,
but I am also interested in languages like C, Java, Koltin & Go!

My main passions are:
* Low requirement, fast & optimal software
* Development of fun games (currently experimenting with WASM!)
* Tool development for automation

```rust,linenos
/// Very intricate function
fn do_we_need_higlights(lucky_n: i32) -> bool {
    lucky_n > 4
}
let highlight = do_we_need_highlights(5);
println!("Well, hai");
```
