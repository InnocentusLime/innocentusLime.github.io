# Hello

My name is Innokentii. I am a beginner software engineer! My main language currently is Rust,
but I am also interested in languages like C, Java, Koltin & Go!

My main passions are:
* Low requirement, fast & optimal software
* Development of fun games (currently experimenting with WASM!)
* Tool development for automation
