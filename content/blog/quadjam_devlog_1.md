# I am alive!

A lot of things have happened after I posted the [arcanoid blog entry](/blog/rust-arconoid).
Even this GitHub page has been reworked quite a few times for various reasons.
But what good is a programmer or their website when they don't actually do projects?
What good is in the stagnation!

With that said, this the first, long overdue devlog entry for a new project of mine.
Much-much more intricate than a simple arcanoid!

# Inspiration

I played Little Big Planet 2 a lot when I was a kid. I loved a lot of levels in that
game. One my favourites was the level called "Invasion of The Body Invaders".
In particular, the boss (skip to 1:51 for the actual boss).

{{ youtube(class="yt-embed", id="mJ9JRI-dPnc", autolpay=false) }}

That level was amazing. Not only it had ["Vision One" by RÃ¶yksopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNyiTdFKYyI)
playing in the background - there was something captivating about the boss itself!
While even the young me understood that it was technically just a bunch of small
balls, the way it moved and interracted with the level was very fun. The idea of
you fighting this large blob of goo was really cool too!

However, the level felt short, really short, too short. It made
sense in the scope of the game - it is just a boss. But I always wanted
more.

So here we are. It is 2025 and I can code. Looks like a perfect opportunity to
tap into that childhood dream. This is where "Project Swarm" starts its life!

# Getting started

After writing an arcanoid in macroquad that works in the browser, I decided,
that I now have the competenence to implement my new idea (what a fool). 
So I decided to recycle the code for Project Swarm. I immediately ran into a problem -
I needed physics and I really am not a person capable of writing physics simulations (yet).

For that reason, I grabbed what was available "on the market" - `rapier`.
`Rapier` is a fast, advanced physics engine written entirely in Rust[^1]. 
It has a good interop with the Bevy game engine[^2] and the Godot game engine[^3].

However, that "advanced" part is a double-edged sword. `Rapier` is complicated.
Unless you write everything with rapier in mind beforehand, you will immediately
find yourself writing some sort of wrapper around this monster... And trying to
stop the wrapper itself turning into something hideous! 

To cope with the overwhelming complexity and to connect everything nicely, I decided that
some form of dependency-injection framework could help. Which brings me to the other large component
inside the game: [shipyard](https://crates.io/crates/shipyard). `Shipyard` is one of many
Rust ECS imeplementations. Why is everyone in the Rust community trying to implement an ECS?
No idea!

# What's ECS

First of all, ECS is an architectural pattern. It is how you group the code. It is
not a silver bullet that solves all possible problems. Here I will not dwelve into 
the technicalities of implementing an ECS pattern. Just the most basic understanding.
You have Wikipedia for in-depth stuff and actual Game Developer presentations for
pros and cons. 

What does that mean?  Imagine the way you would most likely write a game object. 
Unless you have chronic  academicisis or love functional programming, it would be 
something like this

```c++
class MyCharacter {
private:
    hp: int;
    pos: vector2f,
public:
    Update() { 
        hp += 1 // regeneration 
    }

    Render() { 
        draw_rectangle(pos)
        draw_hp(pos, hp)
    }
    
    Move(delta: vector2) {
        pos += delta
    }
    
    GetHurt(dmg: int) {
        hp -= dmg
        Move(-vector2(-dmg, 0)) // Knockback
    }
}
```

Basically, you would follow these OOP-like principles: 

* The data is protected 
* The data and the means of manipulating it are together in a class

In contract, in ECS-like architecture: 

* You through that whole "protection" business out of the window
* The data and the manipulation means are decoupled into two things: storage and systems

The storage is usually keyed by some value: `EntityId`. This allows us to recognise
that some components belong to a single thing: an **entity**.

```cpp
class Storage {
private:
    /* Some cool data structure */
public:
    GetHealth(who: EntityId) -> int { /* ... */ }
    SetHealth(who: EntityId, hp: int) { /* ... */ }

    GetPos(who: EntityId) -> vector2 { /* ... */ }
    SetPos(who: EntityId, pos: vector2) { /* ... */ }
}

damageSystem(storage: Storage) {
    gotShot: EntityId = findVictim()
    dmg: int = calculateDamage()
    storage.SetHealth(gotShot, storage.GetHealth() - dmg)
}
```

# The prototype

With those tools, I first and foremost added a wrapper around `rapier`. At that point
in time, what I did was implement a special component called `PhysicsInfo`. 

```rust
pub struct PhysicsInfo {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub groups: InteractionGroups,
    col: ColliderTy,
    body: RigidBodyHandle,
}
```

You can actually see that it is not quite a plain-data component, despite what I said.
The past me didn't think that it would be a huge problem, but that decision came to bite
me later. I will not dwelve into the design problems in this post though.

What I also did is add a quite complex singleton component called `PhysicsState`. At first
it looked like a good idea, because that allowed to do nice clean calls like `physics.any_collisions`
to test if something collided with a shape. However, that is where all the benefits of
going against the "plain-data" rule stopped. 

```rust
pub struct PhysicsState {
    /* Lots and lots of rapier-specific goodness */
}
```

Despite that, I still could ship a rather decent prototype. You can view the code from
back in time right here at commit 
[`f942cf0`](https://github.com/InnocentusLime/quad-jam-2024/tree/f942cf0a5626431dd2c3ce7b80ba3f20e385f694). 
There were several gameplay iterations I went through, but for now I decided to go with a
simple laser beam with a teleporting bullet. 
Maybe I will implement the same attack mechanic the orginal level in Little Big Planet 2 had. 
Who knows!

# Future work

While programming and testing all of that was fun... 
It was hard to ignore that the movement of the "swarm" wasn't like in Little
Big Planet! You can see that on the video: the structure of these circles is firm and
brittle, not soft and squishy. The current implementation works like this:

```rust
// Basically, all cells are: 
// 1. pulled towards each other
// 2. pulled towards the player
for enemy in enemies {
    for fella_enemy in enemies {
        enemy.force += (fella_enemy.pos - enemy.pos) * GROUP_FORCE;
    }
    enemy.force += (player_pos - enemy.pos).normalize() * CHASE_FORCE;
}
```

I believe tinkering with the numbers more should help. There's no way this thing
isn't just a bunch of physics-based circles - that I know for sure. Perhaps I also need
to mess around with the "material properties" too. 

# What's next?

Good question! I have quite a lot of plans for that small game and this page too!

First of all, this game isn't going to be an infinite investment. Projects need to end
one day and this game is not an exception. I will refine the vision of the "final product"
in the next post and set it as the goal with an appropiate time limit.

Second of all, while the arcanoid thing was quickly turned into a short "what has been done" report,
I think this project will have a more or less full-fledged devlog. I will reflect on the design
decisions and share my progress as I move forward.

And of course... I will occasionally cleanup the `.css` and the `.html` templates to keep things
fresh looking! You can follow the game development closely on GitHub right [here](https://github.com/InnocentusLime/quad-jam-2024).
